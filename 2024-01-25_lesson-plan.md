## Lesson Plan: Creating Interactive and Collaborative maps using GeoJSON

**Objectives:**
* Understand the basics of GeoJSON format and its use in visualizing geographic data.
* Learn how to create and import a GeoJSON file using geojson.io.
* Collaborate by contributing your additions to the shared Github repository.
* Create an interactive map using HTML and the Leaflet.js library.

**Materials:**

* Github account
* Online GeoJSON editor: [https://geojson.io/](https://geojson.io/)
* Using GeoJSON in Leaflet: [https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/](https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/)

**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Activities:**

Build a geoJSON file that you can save to Github, using these paramaters:

**1. Create the map:**

Use the **Draw Polygon** tool to accurately trace the boundaries of the map.
- Northern boundary: 34th St
- Southern boundary: Canal St
- Eastern boundary: East River
- Western boundary: Hudson River

**2. Add subway stations:**
- Add markers for each subway station using the **Draw Point** tool.
- For each created marker, clikc on it and add features by using the rows on the **Properties** tab
- Add these properties: name, line
- Make sure to comment which parts you added, in the geoJSON file (attribution!). Can use a property called "added:"
- Save the geoJSON file and uplaod to the shared Github repository
